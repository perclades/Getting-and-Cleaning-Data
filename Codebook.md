Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Code Book
The initial step was read the data files into R, then i did the following steps:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. I created the tidy data set with the rbind() function.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. I did this with the functions select() and contains() from the package dplyr.

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. I changed the codes in tidy with the activities in the file activity_labels.txt.

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. I did this with the gsub() function and some regular expressions.

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. For this step, first i used the functions group_by() and summarize_all() (variation of the summarize() function) from the package dplyr.

Initial data
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ tGravityAcc-XYZ tBodyAccJerk-XYZ tBodyGyro-XYZ tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ tBodyAccMag tGravityAccMag tBodyAccJerkMag tBodyGyroMag tBodyGyroJerkMag fBodyAcc-XYZ fBodyAccJerk-XYZ fBodyGyro-XYZ fBodyAccMag fBodyAccJerkMag fBodyGyroMag fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value std(): Standard deviation mad(): Median absolute deviation max(): Largest value in array min(): Smallest value in array sma(): Signal magnitude area energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. iqr(): Interquartile range entropy(): Signal entropy arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4 correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window. angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean tBodyAccMean tBodyAccJerkMean tBodyGyroMean tBodyGyroJerkMean

Feature transformation
A factor variable called Activity with the following levels: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

The initial variables with some modifications in the names. Some variables are specified in this way:

Subject.
Activity.
TimeBody: Accelerometer-Gyroscope Jerk-Mean-Std X-Y-Z.
TimeGravity: Accelerometer Jerk-Mean-Std X-Y-Z.
FrecuencyBody: Accelerometer-Gyroscope Jerk-Magnitude-Mean-Std X-Y-Z.

I used the write.table() function to save the file tidy_dataset.txt.
